There is no one definitive answer, as the meaning of life is a personal and subjective experience. However, some common themes that have emerged in discussions about the meaning of life include:\n> \n> 1. **Purpose and Fulfillment:** Many people find meaning in their lives by pursuing goals and activities that bring them a sense of purpose and fulfillment. This could be through personal, professional, or creative endeavors, or by contributing to the well-being of others.\n> \n> 2. **Relationships and Connection:** Human relationships and connections with others can be a significant source of meaning. Building strong and supportive relationships, whether with family, friends, or a community, can provide a sense of belonging, love, and shared experiences.\n> \n> 3. **Values and Beliefs:** Living in accordance with one's values and beliefs can also contribute to a sense of meaning. This could involve striving for justice, equality, or other ethical ideals, or leading a life guided by spiritual or religious principles.\n> \n> 4. **Growth and Learning:** The pursuit of knowledge, personal growth, and learning new skills can provide a sense of fulfillment and purpose. Continuously expanding one's horizons and challenging oneself intellectually can lead to a more meaningful life experience.\n> \n> 5. **Contribution and Impact:** Making a positive impact on the world or leaving a legacy can be a source of meaning for many people. This could be through contributions to society, the environment, or future generations. It can involve volunteering, charitable work, or simply being a positive force in the lives of others.\n> \n> 6. **Experiences and Moments:** Life experiences, both big and small, can contribute to a sense of meaning. Joyful moments, moments of awe and wonder, or overcoming challenges can all add depth and richness to life, making it more meaningful.\n> \n> Ultimately, the meaning of life is a personal journey, and what brings meaning to one person may not be the same for another. It is a question that individuals may reflect on throughout their lives, and the answer may evolve over time."},"metadata":{},"execution_count":16}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### Single API Call"],"metadata":{"id":"bX74n3h8DcSe"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["test_set_sample = test_set.sample(20)\n","\n","test_set_sample['pred_label'] = ''\n","\n","test_set_sample"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":677},"id":"F0sqSsYuGw8L","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1706856334257,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":845,"user":{"displayName":"Gopal Sharma","userId":"12839894256006393174"}},"outputId":"16d400ac-1934-4cfa-d38c-8a6f9492d217"},"execution_count":17,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                 review  label  \\\n","66    Fast response which was amazing.

times it seems very intuitive but at other times ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result installation was fairly straightforward but messed up several times simply because

issue of the moment is that we have several echo devices in our home and would like to use them as intercoms which am told can be done however can make any of the echos aware of the others existence

screen you can turn off the screen scroll but that defeats the purpose of having the screen don need to be reminded every 5 seconds what things can do with alexa don need the advertising especially at

swiping up rather than touching screen when you are half asleep is very difficult and results in setting snooze more than half the time even if you really try to swipe to dismiss and ii if you do manage to swipe up to dismiss then you completely delete your recurring alarm this is especially annoying as amazon could so easily fix this by simply making touching the screen turn off the alarm but not delete it or at least make it setting to decide whether touching the screen for recurring alarm snoozes or turns it off but as the clock has been out for year now and they still haven adding this
